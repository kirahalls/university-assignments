- No one

[x] I solemnly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to puchase a domain and connect everything to my actual files. It was really interesting to see everything come together. 
I also really liked being able to see the results of the process when I first started seeing the bad gateway message, then my webpages, etc. 

The hardest thing in this assignment was figuring out the WSL commands. I was really confused about how I was supposed to get into the WSL program at first, as 
I had never used it before. It took me a while to remember to actually go into that program to run the commands instead of just running them normally from the terminal.

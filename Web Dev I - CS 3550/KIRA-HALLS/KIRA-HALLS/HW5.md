----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [x] Phase 1
- [x] Phase 2
- [x] Phase 3
- [x] Phase 4
- [x] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:

- No one, apart from reading piazza posts

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to authenticate users and determine what role they had. It was super interesting to see how I could restrict certain pages from being viewed just based on whether or not they were logged in. I also thought it was cool to see that I can customize a webpage so it looks different for a TA than it does for a student.

The hardest thing in this assignment was validating and protecting the files and views. I had a hard time testing everything to make sure I couldn't access invalid files or views. Specifically, I had a hard time figuring out the HttpResponse headers at the end of Phase 5, it took me a while to figure out what I was supposed to do and how that would impact the browser viewing my submission.

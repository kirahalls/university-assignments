In this assignment, I completed:

- [x] Phase 2
- [x] Phase 3
- [x] Phase 4
- [x] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:

- No one, apart from researching basic JavaScript info on the official docs/websites provided

[x] I solemnly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to modify HTML elements using javascript. I think it's really cool that I can alter them once certain events occur, or even add new elements later on. I really enjoyed seeing the impact of clicking on my page and being able to see the new elements I added, or look at the changes I made to preexisting elements.

The hardest thing in this assignment was phase 5, as it took me a long time to figure out the right syntax for reassigning the td values when I switched from input elements back to their original data. It took me a long time to debug why my td elements would randomly be empty after I clicked between "hypothesized" and "actual grades" a few times.

Homework 4 Cover Sheet
----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [x] Phase 1
- [x] Phase 2
- [x] Phase 3
- [x] Phase 4
- [x] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:

- No one, apart from reading posts and making a post on piazza to clarify some confusion with an error in phase 3. 

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how save grades from the webpage. It was really cool to see how the front-end
and back-end connected to allow the user to interact with the form to modify the database. I also thought it was interesting that we can 
directly interact with the request.POST field to do so, as I didn't really understand that before. I understand requests a lot better now because of this section.

The hardest thing in this assignment was figuring out how to iterate over my dictionary that contained my errors in phase 3. For some reason, I had a really hard time understanding why my output elements wouldn't show up on the table. I was trying to iterate over a dictionary that hadn't been properly transformed so I could iterate over it. It took me a long time to figure out what the issue was, 
how to fix it, etc.

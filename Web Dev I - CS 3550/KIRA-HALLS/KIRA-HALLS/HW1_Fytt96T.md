The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was the accessibility requirements and how to implement them. I had never really thought about the
accessibility aspects on websites before, and it was interesting to learn how much the little details matter. For example, I didn't realize that it was 
really important for the screen reader accessibility feature to have landmarks to navigate the page with. I liked adding the "role" attributes to help 
with the screen reader, specifically.

The hardest thing in this assignment was understanding tables. It took me quite a while to understand when I need to use a table vs. when I should use a regular
section or paragraph designation. It also took me a while to understand the formatting of tables, as I got pretty confused by the difference between <thead>
 and <th> tags. I had to reformat my pages several times as I realized I had included things that didn't need to be included in the tables, or I didn't format 
 them correctly.

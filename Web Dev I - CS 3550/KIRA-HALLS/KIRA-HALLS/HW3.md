- [x] Phase 3

I discussed this assignment with:

- No one, apart from reading piazza posts and doing general research for understanding 
certain django concepts better 

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to write for loops in django 
templates. I haven't seen anything like it before, and it was really interesting to learn the 
format and see it in action by seeing my tables filled out with the correct data. I also thought writing templates in general was really interesting, I liked figuring out how to format my {{}} elements to make everything work correctly.

The hardest thing in this assignment was learning how to properly query. I haven't had a lot of database experience before, so understanding how I was supposed to pass things like the assigned number of grades per assignment for one TA took quite a bit of work. It took a while for me to understand what each element of the query was for, but once I got the hang of it I really enjoyed it. I also didn't know about the zip() function until I read a piazza post about it, so I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to access individual elements in a python list in a template which was difficult.

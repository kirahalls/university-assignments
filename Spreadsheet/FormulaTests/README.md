# Description

This class contains all tests for the Formula class. It adapts many tests from assignment 1
to test the same functions in assignment three (syntax, formula evaluation, etc). Aside from those 
tests, it also tests the different formula constructors in each test, tests associated with normalizers and the 
isValid function, formula equality, etc. Each test has a comment to describe what is being tested.

# Comments to Evaluators:

Some tests for this assignment are adapted from my tests from assignment 1, but altered to work with this class.

# Assignment Specific Topics

No additional writeup required for this assignment.

# Consulted Peers:

I did not consult any peers while writing this testing code, as I found that all my questions were answered in lecture, 
through research, or on Piazza.

# Repository Structure 
This repository is organized mainly into categories by courses - Data Structures - CS 2420, Spreadsheet (CS 3500 semester long project), Software Practice II - CS 3505, and Computer Systems - CS 4400. This organization structure has two notable exceptions - PlantDoctor and Wordle. I kept these projects separate as I feel they showcase a well-rounded overview of my coding abilities, and they are more interesting for users to look at as they both are a game-like project so both have an interactive UI right off. 

Each individual project includes a README file to describe the project as well as what I learned through completing the projects.

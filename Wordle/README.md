# Wordle Style Puzzle Game
This project is a word-guessing game in a similar style to the popular game Wordle. 
The goal of the game is to correctly guess the selected five letter word, called the 'secret word'. Users have five guesses to 
try and figure out the secret word. To play, they input their five letter word guess and the system outputs a string representing
the validity of their guess. For each letter in the input word, the system outputs a corresponding symbol to show that the letter 
is in the word and is in the correct position (uppercase letter), in the word but in an incorrect position (lowercase letter), or 
not in the word at all (-).
